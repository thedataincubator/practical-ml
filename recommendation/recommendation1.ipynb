We will be building applications that attempts to present movies that a given user would rate highly.  Extracting the zip file in the current directory should create a directory called `ml-10M100K/`.  The data wil be in several `.dat` files.  Let's take a look at the list of movies."

As we see ratings from users come it, we formulate a **posterior** estimate of the rating, taking into account both the prior and the new information provided by the ratings.  The posterior estimate of the rating, after seeing the $n$ reviews $\\{x_i\\}$, can be written as\n",

Looking a little bit down the list, we see a recommendation for *The Thing*, which seems very reasonable.  *Ghostbusters* also ranks highly.  This is somewhat surprising, since our user didn't rate any comedies.  Evidently, other fans of horror films like *Ghostbusters* anyway, so maybe our user should give it a try."

Can you find an encoding that's in between these two options?  How does the scale of the year, if treated as a continuous feature, affect the KNN calculation?  You may want to use a `StandardScaler`, from `sklearn.preprocessing`, to reduce this effect.\n",

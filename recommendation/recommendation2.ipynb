    "## Overfitting and Cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "This discrepancy is a sign that we may be **overfitting**.  Training data is never perfectly clean.  It contains both the underlying signal, which you want to model, and some random noise, which you do not.  If your model has enough flexibility, it may fit both the noise and the signal.  When tested against other data with the same signal but different noise, it will perform poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The noise in this case is the same issue that prompted us to use a Bayesian mean to rate the movies suggested by neighbor users.  Prior to seeing any ratings for a item, for example, we would expect $b_i = 0$.  After seeing a single rating $r$, we shouldn't set $b_i = r - mu$.  Instead, we should update our estimate or $b_i$ somewhat in between these values, depending on our confidence in the prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we could add in prior ratings by hand.  A more general solution is to take advange of **regularized** linear models.  These models add a penalty for non-zero coefficients in the linear regression.  This reduces the flexibility of the model, thereby reducing the chance of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using **ridge regression**, which adds a term proportion to $\\beta^2$ to the quantity being minimized:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\left|y - X\\cdot\\beta\\right|^2 + \\alpha\\ \\left|\\beta\\right|^2 \\ . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Like linear regression, this model is analytically soluble.  (Ridge regression reduces to linear regression in the limit $\\alpha\\to0$.)  If the model is being used to take an average, as happens with one-hot encoding, the resultant coefficients will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat\\beta_i = \\frac{\\sum_{j\\mid X_{ij}=1} y_j}{n + \\alpha} \\ , $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of $y_j$ included in the sum.  Note that this is equivalent to our previous Bayesian mean, with $\\mu=0$ and $N=\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weight $\\alpha$ is a **hyperparameter** of the model.  We must set it in order to ensure the best performance of the model.  To find the appropriate value, we use **cross-validation**: training the model on a traning set and evaluating its performance of a test set.  $\\alpha$ is adjusted to achieve the best performance on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we could use a static train-test split for the testing, there are several cross-validation methods that allow us to test performace across an entire data set, while still checking for overfitting.  The most common is ***k*-fold validation**.  In this scheme, the data set is split up into $k$ portions, or folds.  The model is trained on $k-1$ of them and tested on the last fold.  Then the folds are rotated and the process repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for each candidate $\\alpha$, we would need to train and test $k$ times and average the results.  This would become tedious quickly.  Luckily, *Scikit Learn* provides the `GridSearchCV` class that performs a **grid search** over our hyperparameters.  It takes an estimator as an argument, along with the grid of hyperparameters to be searched over.  (Note that parameters of elements of a pipe can be referenced with the `element-name__parameter-name` convention.) "

    "1. Implement another user-item interaction model.  Here are a few ideas:\n",
    "   - Measure how similar the user is to fans of the item, and regress against that distance.\n",
    "   - Measure how similar the item is to items the user likes, and regress against that distance.\n",
    "   - Use a nearest neighbors approach to report the scores given to an item by users similar to the user in question.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Blend two (or more) interaction models together.  These can be different algorithms from (1) or several matrix factorization algorithms with different hyperparameters.  Linear regression is a good way to automatically perform a weighted average together.  The BellKor team had success with **gradient-boosted trees** as blenders.\n",

    "3. Add features of the movie or user to the blend.  A nonlinear model, such as **random forest** or gradient-boosted trees, may be able to detect that one of the component models does particularly well for a certain subset of features."
